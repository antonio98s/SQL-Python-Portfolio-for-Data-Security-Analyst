# Cyber Fraud Detection Portfolio

Projects demonstrating Python and SQL skills for fraud analysis and anomaly detection.

## Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Objective**: Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning on a real-world imbalanced dataset.

**Dataset**: [Credit Card Fraud Detection (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) – 284,807 transactions (492 fraud cases).

**Skills Used**:
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Handling imbalanced data with class weights
- Random Forest classification
- Model evaluation (precision, recall, confusion matrix)

**Key Results**:
- Achieved **~92–95% recall** on fraud class (critical for minimizing false negatives)
- Identified top predictive features (e.g., V14, V17, V10)
