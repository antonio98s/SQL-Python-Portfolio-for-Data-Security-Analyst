# SQL & Python Portfolio for Data/Security Analyst Roles

Hi, I'm Antonio, a fraud investigation professional with CompTIA Security+ certification. I'm skilled in SQL for data querying and Python for automation/analysis, with experience detecting patterns in financial data. This portfolio showcases projects relevant to Data Analyst, Crypto Surveillance Analyst, and Cyber Security Analyst roles.

## Projects
1. [Fraud Detection Analyzer](#fraud-detection-analyzer)
2. [Security Log Parser](#security-log-parser)
3. [Crypto Transaction Monitor](#crypto-transaction-monitor)
4. [Vulnerability Scanner Script](#vulnerability-scanner-script)

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL: Querying, joining, aggregating data for insights.
- Python: Data manipulation (Pandas), machine learning (Scikit-learn), automation (scripts for security tasks).
- Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, (add others like Tableau if you use them).
- Relevance: Ties into fraud detection from my professional experience.
